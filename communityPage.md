Spiritual Growth
Etherean Mission is the road to total spiritual freedom and creative abilities.  It gives you the opportunity to study the core principles of life and provides you with the requisite tools and abilities to handle life and the universe you live in.

We are Spiritual Educators for the realization of the finished kingdom of God that is present in everybody.

Etherean Mission is a place of joy, where all are supported to discover and express the highest good and purity that they are. Each person embodies the full pure presence of God and our conscious practice, therefore is to see and express the good and the divine in ourselves and in all of life.  That is the practice of love.

Your Spiritual University
When Christianity missed out on Jesusâ€™ teaching that the Kingdom of God is within each one of us, it lost its touch with spirituality and that is where Etherean Mission starts its spiritual journey.

Etherean Mission is rich with spiritual wisdom, and we may best be described as the University of Spirituality.

There are two school systems in life; Secular Education, provided by our school systems and Spiritual Education that is to be provided by our religious institutions.

When it comes to Spiritual Education, most religious bodies are virtually bankrupt. Religion has become a set of fear based dogmas that keep changing from one religious sect to the other. Spirituality on the other hand is to listen to the Indwelling Presence and do what is right for you and the world you live in.

Religion separates people, spirituality unites all. Religion is about hell fire and a final destiny, spirituality teaches the immutable of karma and puts you on your own unique eternal journey. As unique that everyone is, each person has a unique path for his or her soul evolution.
